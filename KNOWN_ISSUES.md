# Aviation Lights /L Unleashed :: Known Issues

* On KSP 1.3.x and 1.4.0, there's a heavy Z fight on the light's lens. This is due the models being targeted to KSP >= 1.4.1 with `ModulePartVariants`.
	+ Other than pretty annoying, it works fine.
	+ As a workaround, the legacy lights are made available on the Parts Menu on KSP 1.3.x and the newest light is hidden.
		- On KSP >= 1.4 it's the other way: the newest is available, and the older lights are hidden. 
		- It will probably bork on KSP 1.4.0, though, as KSPe don't give us tags to target PATCH level numbers (only Major and Minor versions).
	+ How to **really**solve that is RiP at this moment.
		- [B9 Part Switch]() perhaps?
