	+ For KSP 1.3.0 / 1.3.1

* 2017-0526: 3.13 (MOARdV) for KSP 1.3.0
	+ Recompiled for KSP 1.3.0

		- Re-enabled right-click menus in the VAB.
* 2016-1012: 3.11 (MOARdV) for KSP 1.2.0
	+ FIXED: Hang when hovering over aviation lights.
	+ FIXED: Flash interval backwards when toggling Flash mode when the light was on.
	+ CHANGED: Part names so they show up together (instead of "Red Beaconlight", it's now "Light, Beacon, Red").  This is _not_ a save-breaking change.
	+ CHANGED: Converted PNG textures to DDS, and resized them to 128 x 128 (256 x 256 is way too big for the part size - 128 x 128 is still probably bigger than it needs to be).
