# Aviation Lights :: Change Log

* 2018-0403: 4.0.1 (MOARdV) for KSP 1.4.0
	+ For KSP 1.4.0 - KSP 1.4.2
			- Added tags to the lights, including cck_lights for compatibility with the Community Category Kit.
* 2018-0331: 4.0.0 (MOARdV) for KSP 1.4.0
	+ For KSP 1.4.0 - KSP 1.4.2
	+ There are many changes in this version of Aviation Lights.  I recommend you spend a few minutes going through the [readme](https://github.com/MOARdV/AviationLights/blob/master/README.md) file.
			- Old Aviation Lights are now hidden in the editor.  They may be unhidden using a Module Manager patch.
			- New fully-configurable aviation light is available in the editor.  Light color and mode (navigation, beacon, strobe) are configurable using presets, housing and lens styles are configurable.  Using Advanced Tweakables allows more fine-tuning of the light.
* 2017-0526: 3.14 (MOARdV) for KSP 1.3.0
	+ For KSP 1.3.0 / 1.3.1
	+ Fixes NRE in VAB/SPH when trying to set flash mode to Flash, Double Flash, or Interval.
* 2017-0526: 3.13 (MOARdV) for KSP 1.3.0
	+ Recompiled for KSP 1.3.0
* 2016-1020: 3.12 (MOARdV) for KSP 1.2.
	+ For KSP 1.2.x
		- Re-enabled right-click menus in the VAB.
* 2016-1012: 3.11 (MOARdV) for KSP 1.2.0
	+ FIXED: Hang when hovering over aviation lights.
	+ FIXED: Flash interval backwards when toggling Flash mode when the light was on.
	+ CHANGED: Part names so they show up together (instead of "Red Beaconlight", it's now "Light, Beacon, Red").  This is _not_ a save-breaking change.
	+ CHANGED: Converted PNG textures to DDS, and resized them to 128 x 128 (256 x 256 is way too big for the part size - 128 x 128 is still probably bigger than it needs to be).
* 2016-1011: 3.10 (MOARdV) for KSP 1.2.0
	+ Aviation Lights recompiled for KSP 1.2.0
* 2016-0508: 3.9 (MOARdV) for KSP 1.1.

	+ KSP 1.0.5
	+ This snapshot is to provide a reference state for the source code as of the AviationLights v3.8 release.  The download is not provided.
